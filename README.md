✋Hello! My name is Ignacio, and I'm a 21 years old Uruguayan 🇺🇾 university student passionate about software development and the world of computer science and technology.

📘Throughout my studies, I've worked with a wide variety of technologies such as **MySQL, Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among many others**. 

⚛️On my own, I am learning new technologies for user interface design such as **Tailwind CSS and React**. While I am very interested in the logic of programming and how things work at a more complex level, I also have a strong interest in creating modern and competitive interfaces that catch the end user's attention while making their life easier!

Here, on my GitHub profile, you'll find the projects I've been working on most recently!
