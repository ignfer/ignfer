Hi! my name is Ignacio, im a 20 years old student passionate about learning about coding and design.
I have experience working with java, javascript, visual basics, and more.
Currently I'm also studying C and C++ on the University, I want to keep learning as much as posible 
so I can get myself a job on the development industry.
