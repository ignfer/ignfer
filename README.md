✋Hello! My name is Ignacio, and I'm a 21 years old Uruguayan 🇺🇾 university student passionate about software development and the world of computer science and technology.

* [Visit my LinkedIn 💼](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignaciofern%C3%A1ndez/)
  
📘Throughout my studies, I've worked with a wide variety of technologies such as **MySQL, Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among many others**. 

⏰Currently on I am learning new technologies for user interface design such as ⚛️**React** and I also keep learning ☕**Java**.
While I am very interested in the logic of programming and how things work at a more complex level, I also have a strong interest in creating modern and competitive interfaces that catch the end user's attention while making their life easier!

Here, on my GitHub profile, you'll find the projects I've been working on most recently!
