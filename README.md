### About me
* ✋ Hello! I'm Ignacio, a Front-End Developer and UX/UI Designer from Uruguay 🇺🇾. I'm passionate about software development, computer science, and technology.

* 💼 Since April 2024, I've been working as a full-time Front-End Developer at a fast-paced tech startup focused on logistics and freight forwarding. This role has provided me the opportunity to grow professionally, take initiative, and tackle complex projects early in my career.

* 🖌️ With a strong focus on aesthetics and a creative background, I bring unique value as a developer who seamlessly integrates brand design and UX/UI principles into front-end work. Currently, I'm also expanding my skill set by delving deeper into backend development.

* 🤖 As part of my professional journey, I've taken the lead in researching and implementing LLMs (Large Language Models) and intelligent agent-based solutions to deliver quick, actionable insights and create added value for the company.
